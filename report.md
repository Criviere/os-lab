##This is a report about what I learned from Lab 1.
###Author(s): Camilo Riviere (PID:4060057) & Camilo Rivera (PID:5574139)

- The first thing we learned was how to setup a Linux distribution on a virtual machine.
After learning how to setup and utilize the virtual machine we learned how to install
and compile a new kernel file into a Linux operating system. We also learned how to manipulate the "boot loader config file" also known as "grub" which allows us to choose the kernel we want to use with our operating system.

- After learning the basics of Linux we then learned how to write and install a Kernel module which allows us to print out a message at the kernel level of the operating system.

- The integral of this lab was to learn how to implement a custom system call into our linux kernel which allows us to present kernel messages and to reuse our system call in to any test file we create within the kernel.

- The last component of the lab was to learn how to generate a patch file which allows us to differentiate between the original and modified kernel files.
